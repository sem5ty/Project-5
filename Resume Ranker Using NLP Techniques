With the increase in job applications for each opening, recruiters face the challenge of efficiently screening and ranking large volumes of resumes to identify top candidates.
This project introduces an AI-Based Resume Ranking System that automates the screening process by ranking resumes based on their relevance to a specific job description. 
Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the system calculates the similarity between job descriptions and candidate resumes, providing recruiters with a prioritized list of candidates.
The system begins by extracting and preprocessing text from resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX) and uses spaCyâ€™s Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify essential details, such as names and email addresses. With TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, both the job description and resumes are transformed into numerical vectors. Cosine similarity is then applied to measure the relevance of each resume to the job description, resulting in a similarity score that enables effective ranking. The ranked results are displayed in a user-friendly interface and can be exported in CSV format for further analysis
